Hout

Hout offers SaaS and allows users( through clients ) to have a democratic and intuitive approach to organizing meetups within their peer-group.

Each meetup has invitees, and each invitee has an option to suggest a time and a place for the meetup, and each invitee RSVPs to whichever suggestion(s) he prefers. The suggestion with the most votes is chosen as the finalized suggestion for the meetup.
